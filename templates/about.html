      <h1>About the Detailed Economic Window</h1>
      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>The Detailed Economic Window (DEW) was born from the <a href = "http://www.districtdatalabs.com/#!incubator/c185j">District Data Labs Incubator Program</a>. The goal of this project is to help those in the public and private sectors make efficient investment decisions. For this project, out team estimated economic activity and demand by analyzing historic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) amongst others. At the same time, we created predictive algorithms identifying regions of the country with overwhelming demand for specific industries, skills or resources. The outcome of these efforts is an interactive national map showing these results.</p>

      <h2>District Data Labs</h2>
      <p>
The idea for District Data Labs grew out of DC's vibrant data science community and the melting pot of statisticians, data consultants, analytics contractors, hackers, and entrepreneurs that belong to it. The stated goal of District Data Labs is to become 'an efficient learning resource for people who want to enhance and expand their analytical and technical skill sets.'
